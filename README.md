# carrom-sim

The goal of this repository is to create a carrom board simulator which will further be used to develop a robotics enabled carrom player.

## TODO:
- Create a 2D physics engine.   (in progress)
- Create a carrom scene.
- Simulate the environment.
- Check consistency with real world carroms.
- Use graph algorithms to find the optimum shot to be taken.
- Build a robotic manipulator to trigger the striker.
